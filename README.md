# ROS-TurtleBot-Tutorial
This is a tutorial to run TurtleBot examples on ROS1 and ROS2 using a self-contained Docker environment provided via this repository. We explain two modes of navigation: teleopreation using the keyboard and setting a goal via the RViz UI. These tutorials can easily be extended for autonomous navigation too but for the scope of this tutorial, we will only discuss the above mentioned modes of navigation.

## Prerequisites

### Docker
The Docker platform is used to install and run the container containing all the necessary simulation and the code files. Different OS platforms have different installation instructions. Checkout the getting started [guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to install and run your first Docker container relevant to your OS.
